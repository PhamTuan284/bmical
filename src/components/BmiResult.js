                BMI uses your height and weight to work out if you're a healthy
                weight, underweight or overweight. Your BMI result is not the
                perfect measure of your overall health. It can't tell if you're
                carrying too much fat or you've got a lot of muscle. You could
                use your BMI result as a starting point for further discussion
                with your GP. The adult BMI doesn't take into account age, sex
                or musclar build. This means that:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Older adults can have a healthy BMI but still have too much
                  fat. This is because older adults tend to have more body fat
                  than younger adults.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Women can have a healthy BMI but still have too much fat. This
                  is because women tend to have more body fat than men with the
                  same BMI.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you're from a black and ethnic minority group, you're at
                  increased risk of type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 23 or more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An athletic adult with a lot of muscle may have a high BMI but
                  not be overweight. This is because BMI canâ€™t tell the
                  difference between fat and muscle.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you are pregnant, you should use your pre-pregnancy weight to
                work out your BMI. Using your pregnancy weight may not be
                accurate.
